# 💡 VLSI Enthusiast | Digital Circuit Explorer

## 🚀 About Me
Diving into the vast world of VLSI, where tiny chips can do big things—if I can figure out how to wire them up. On a mission to master digital circuit design—one Verilog line at a time. Learning the VLSI game and slowly understanding why everyone says *"timing is everything."*

## 🔹 Skills (Gaining Momentum)
- **Digital Circuit Design & VLSI Fundamentals**
- **Verilog & Xilinx Vivado** (on my way to mastering it)
- **Python & C** (I can write loops… sometimes, but don’t ask for optimization 😆)

## 🤝 Let's Connect
Always excited to connect with fellow circuit lovers—beginners or pros willing to share wisdom and tips. Eager to learn, fail, and laugh along the way!
